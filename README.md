Keras CNN Implementation
 
 All the parameters will be configured from the json file.
 
 This project can be used on any type of dataset:
 
 1. DataPreparation module can be used for data augmentation as well as extraction. This module contains the functionality to preprocess       raw data and create a normalized, balanced dataset.  
 
 2. Train CNN module is used to train the model with optimized parameters. After the completion of training process this module will save       the trained model onto the disk.
  
 3. Test CNN module is used to evaluate the trained model with test data. Once the testing phase is finished, it will also generate the         confusion matrix.
