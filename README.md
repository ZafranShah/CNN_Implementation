Keras CNN Implementation
 
 All the parameters will be configured from the json file.
 
 This project can be used on any type of data:
 
 DataPreparation module can be used for data augmentation as well as extraction. This module contain the functionality to preprocess raw
 data and create a normalized, balanced dataset.  
 
 Train CNN module is used to train the model with different number of layers and optimized parameters. In the end this module save the  
 trained model onto the disk  by the defining the path in the configuration file.
  
 Test CNN module is used to evaluate the trained model with test data.
